This holds the list of questions I faced during my interviews

1. Print the diagonal of matrix. For the below matrix output should be [ 1, 2, 5, 3, 6, 9, 4, 7, 10, 8, 11, 12]

            [  1 2 3 4]
            [  5 6 7 8 ]
            [ 9 10 11 12]


                    
2. Design an iterator for the Binary Tree below in Inorder. Iterator on accessing next should go in the order 
    1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9
    
                 [ 4 ]
                /     \
             [2]      [6]
             / \      / \
           [1] [3]  [5] [8]
                        / \
                      [7] [9]
